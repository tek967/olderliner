## Todo List

* Write Sohpyy/Shopy
* Write the settings engine
* Do MapIO
* Start writing the actual game
* Finnish the bank

#### Potential Projects:
* Make music
* Port it to C# + Unity

#### Allocations:

**sohpyy:** ezintegg
**settings:** ezintegg
**mapio:** jason
**game:** jason + ezintegg
**bank:** ezintegg + jason

#### ideaPad:

for the map section, using a 2d table instaed of an xml would work, but would be very laggy due to the terrible implementation ideas. Using different columns for size, xyz, etc can be very clunky. 
XML would be a better idea, but requires further work.
